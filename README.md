# IMDB_REVIEW_APP-
This project is created for all movie lovers who rely on other users review to choose a movie. I understand how stressfull it is going through tons of reviews. This app will save you the stress and time. 
In this project, I collected a few reviews from imdb website when users enter their movie title in the search box.
The collected data is then processed and visualised.
Streamlit was used to build the app which was then hosted on heroku.
